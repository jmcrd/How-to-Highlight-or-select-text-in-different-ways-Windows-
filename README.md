   - Similar to "Ctrl + C," the selected content is placed in the clipboard, but in the case of "Ctrl + X," it is also removed from its original location.
   - This means that the content is moved to the clipboard and can be pasted elsewhere, but it's also removed from its original location, essentially "cutting" it from there.

In summary, "Ctrl + C" is used for copying content while leaving the original intact, whereas "Ctrl + X" is used for cutting content, removing it from its original location, and placing it in the clipboard for pasting elsewhere. Both shortcuts are useful for managing and transferring content within documents, folders, or applications.

4. **Using the Shift key**:
   - left Click at the beginning of the text you want to select.
   - Hold down the Shift key.
   - left Click at the end of the text you want to select.

   Using Shift and left click together allows you to select multiple items in a row or sequence. Here's how it works:

      1. left Click on the first item you want to select.
      2. Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard.
      3. While holding Shift, left click on the last item you want to select.

      2. Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
      3. While holding Ctrl, left click on each additional item you want to select.

This action allows you to select multiple items individually, regardless of their order or proximity to each other. It's handy for selecting non-contiguous items within a list or group.

These methods should cover most scenarios for selecting or highlighting text in Windows. The exact method you use may vary slightly depending on the application you're working with, but these are the general principles.
   - Holding `Shift`, press `End` to select from cursor to the end of the line.

10. **Ctrl + Mouse Click and Drag:**
