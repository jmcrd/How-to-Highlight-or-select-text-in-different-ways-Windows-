   - Hold down the Shift key.
   - Left-click at the end of the text you want to select.
   - This will select the entire range of text between the two clicks.

   Using Shift and left click together allows you to select multiple items in a row or sequence. 
   1. Left-click on the first item you want to select.
   2. Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard.
   3. While holding Shift, left-click on the last item you want to select.

This action selects all items between the first and last ones you clicked on. It's a useful way to quickly select a range of items without having to individually click on each one.

5. **Using the Arrow Keys**:
   - Click at the beginning of the text you want to select.
   - Hold down the Shift key.
   - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to expand the selection in the desired direction.

6. **Shift + Home/End:**

   - Holding `Shift`, press `Home` to select from the cursor to the start of the line.
   - Holding `Shift`, press `End` to select from the cursor to the end of the line.

7. **ctrl + left click**

   Using Ctrl and left click together allows you to select multiple items that aren't necessarily in a row or sequence.

   1. Left-click on the first item you want to select.
   2. Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
   3. While holding Ctrl, left-click on each additional item you want to select.

These methods should cover most scenarios for selecting or highlighting text in Windows. The exact method you use may vary slightly depending on the application you're working with, but these are the general principles.

The best way to be familiar with these shortcuts and understand how they work is practice.
